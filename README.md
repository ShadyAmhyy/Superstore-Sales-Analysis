# Superstore-Sales-Analysis
A fully dashboard was developed using Tableau Desktop to analyze real-world sales data from an e-commerce business. The objective was to transform complex datasets into a clear and engaging visual story that supports smarter decision-making.

The dashboard features key performance indicators such as profit margin, total profit, quantity sold, and customer count, presented through intuitive KPI cards. It also includes a variety of charts displaying sales and profit by product names and categories, along with a focused analysis of returned orders by sub-category.

Advanced visuals like lollipop and donut charts were used to enhance data storytelling, while a map view highlights regional performance with color-coded cues for top and low-performing areas.

Additional elements include a time series chart with sales forecasts, interactive tables showing most profitable products by region, and a waterfall chart illustrating sub-category contributions to total sales.

Interactive filters allow users to explore the data by year, region, sales, or profit, and to dynamically rank top and bottom performers, creating a seamless and insightful experience.
